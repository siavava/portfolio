A fully functional relational database app built with a
[Python](https://www.python.org/) frontend
and a [MySQL](https://www.mysql.com/) backend.
It is modeled for a collective of publishing houses
and offers data stores and a command-line interface
for querying and analyzing the data.
It offers support for different user modes (_author_, _editor_, _reviewer_),
and each user can opt into password authentication.
Several automation events are handled internally &mdash;
for instance, assigning and re-assigning editors and reviewers,
auto-rejecting submissions that are not within the relevant scope,
and accepting OR rejecting publications once all reviews are in.
