Let blatant audacity be our hallmark.

Let us dream beyond our capacity to imagine,
let us set unobtainable goals, and hold ourselves to unattainable standards.

Let us commit to an impossible task.

And then:
let us go out and fail until we lose the fear of failure.
Let us be naïve. After all, we are still too young to realize that
certain things are impossible &mdash; so let us do them anyway.

Years from now, when we look back at our youth;
let us wonder at how we greatly dared, how naïve we were in
our sincerity and in our yearnings to make a difference.

Let us be amazed at the great odds we took on, by the
great feats we accomplished, and if our fate is such, let
us at least look back at how bravely we fell and went back
out in search of another dose of failure &mdash; how futile it was,
yet how fulfilling.

May our story be one of triumph or one of failure, but not anything in between.
May we be counted among those that poured
immeasurable portions of themselves towards a worthy cause.

Should we not succeed;  
let us regret that we failed miserably,
not that we did not try hard enough.  
Or were not audacious enough.  
Or blatant enough.

Let us dare.
